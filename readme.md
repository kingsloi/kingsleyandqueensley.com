I got married earlier this year and wanted to automate as much as I could. The wife and I were dreading the invitations and then keeping track of who was/wasn't coming. I bought a template ([Union - Wedding Template](https://themeforest.net/item/union-wedding-template-with-page-builder/10450812)), customised it. I wasn't happy with the amount of JS in it, so I integrated Vue 2.0 for the frontend, and Laravel's Lumen for a backend API. It's a bit overkill, but tried to keep it as simple as possible, rather than as fast as possible.
